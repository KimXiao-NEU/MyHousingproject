Portland Maine Apartment Rental Recommendation Engine
Designed to streamline the apartment search process for users by aligning rental options with their specific filters and preferences. The tool operates in two phases: first, it employs a filtering mechanism based on user-defined dealbreakers, systematically eliminating properties that do not meet the essential criteria. Following this initial screening, the program incorporates an apartment ranking system using user-defined importance weights for certain key attributes, implements a weighted scoring mechanism utilizing min-max normalization. This approach ensures that each attribute contributes proportionally to the final ranking, reflecting user preferences accurately. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation and algorithmic design but also showcases the ability to create user-centric solutions that enhance decision-making efficiency.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfa6fe6e-94f9-4dd7-a5ec-6fff2ef0ad58)
